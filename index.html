									<h3>Aidyn Lay</h3>
									<p>Things that went well with the project was us being able to sink in all the work needed to be done as soon as we assigned working roles and having a working prototype even though none of us had any background on unity, I also think that the amount of work we produced was to high quality which makes the project look nicer overall. To improve on our work next time, we could improve on separating the workload more evenly as some people had much larger workloads than others making it a large burden on some and working faster earlier rather than harder later. I found it surprising how far into the prototype we had developed as I only imagined it being extremely bare and more of a movement demo with some random enemies than anything more. In the end the hardest aspects of this project were group work management as it is very difficult to control without having a lot of time or having meetings more often, making it difficult to have everyone on board with an idea as not everyone was available at one time to review it over with the team before implementing the work into the prototype and website.</p>

									<p>One thing that went well is the construction of our unity prototype, everyone had great ideas that were in turn made a reality in unity and with all these features combined we created a great prototype. However, one thing that can be improved is the same as the previous assignment of scheduling more than 1 meeting per week, we did fit in an extra meeting every couple of weeks but not close to two meetings per week, once again it is hard to align 6 schedules with one another to figure out a suitable time but it would be very beneficial if we had as we could document the progress of everyone in the group. One thing that was surprising was the end result of our prototype game, it wasn't anything too fancy but it was a very good starting point to expand on in the future. One thing very important when working in groups is that different people work at different paces. You can't expect someone to have done the work at the exact same time as you, especially when they have other plans or endeavors outside of the assignment.</p>

									<p>Due to a large amount of time for certain members of the group being spent focusing on creating and delivering artifacts for the project plan, the audit trail doesn’t show a wholly correct representation of the entire group’s work. Work on behalf of certain members that spent a lot of time working on the Github site are definitely present, but I don’t believe it can correlate exactly to how much work each group member did.</p>

									<p>I think what went well was that our delivered prototype of our project plan was above my expectations of what I thought we could achieve realistically, which I am very happy about. I think that we all worked well in working towards the common goal of the game, and it made for the prototype to be successfully completed. I think improvements that could be made were in our time management and organisation - we had set deadlines for things to be completed by certain dates, so we could shift all our focus onto the project idea. However, it seemed that once the written content was completed, the work flow slowed down dramatically when needing to move this content onto the Github to present on the website. One thing that really surprised me was how well Teodore’s Unity work for the project plan was. Seeing what he had created I was really pleasantly surprised by how good the prototype looked. With groups, I have learnt that they function really well for assignments when people speak up and are enthusiastic to plan ahead of the work that needs to be completed by deadlines. In having this enthusiasm, it creates an atmosphere where everybody wants to get the work completed so we do not have to stress about getting it done the night before/on the day. </p>

									<p>The audit trail is a good example of how work is allocated in our group. Although some members such as myself have lower contributions on the GitHub repository when compared to the rest of the team, I have been pushing forward the most with the Unity prototype. But as usual the Github Audit Trail does not do a good job of showing how much content was created or edited with each commitment. Some commits may have been larger while some commits may have just been typo edits. But despite this, in most cases the more commits made the more content added by the person overall.</p>

								  <h3>Zachary Ferdinands</h3>
									<p>Overall, the group maintained a steady workflow and managed to keep coming up with consistent ideas while putting out well thought through content in the report, website and prototype. We managed to put out a fleshed out and well produced report that had the most contributions from everyone. I think that the work output was initially a little low to begin with but towards the end of the timeline (roughly a week before due date) the work flow picked up a bit, not to say that we had got nothing done before then. To be honest I was surprised with the quality and polish of the prototype game that TJ put out, I didn't expect something so well done. I learned that the quality of the group’s work is always going to be better when the subject of the assignment is something that the group can share their enjoyment together.</p>
